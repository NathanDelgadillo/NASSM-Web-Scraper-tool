ShipShape Organize ,https://shipshapeorganize.com/,Boston,Deb Stone ,,978.314.6410,Team of 10 Staff. Saw value in PackIt. Felt it could be used for 30% of jobs. Did not see value for jobs that are packed and unpacked in 2 days. Lots of value for items that go to storage. liked idea of trackit. Mentioned about having app to help with estimating on jobs. Interesting in getting demo and potenitally piloting the PackIt. Talked about GentleGiant Moving as their partner (had some sort of tracking app). ,,,"Sent Email 6/7/25, 6/25 deb got back to us ""I have been absolutely swamped and haven't had time to digest or look at it. I will though! Probably end July or early August would be best to reconnect."" 6/27 Sent two dates in august that could work best for her, waiting for confirmation. "
